# BreakoutGameCopy
This is a copy of the Breakout game which was originally made by Atari games. This was my first C++ project. I've used the Stanford open source graphics library.
Steps to play the game - 
Download the folder. You'll need java installed as Stanford libraries need java to run the UI.
make
./breakout
